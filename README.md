Curriculum-Submission-Network
=============================

MRU assignment1 project WebDev3 course

To use this web-app you need to import the assignment1.sql file to your database
and set up the application/config/config.php files as follows

you know just PDO connection variables..

define('DB_HOSTNAME', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'assignment1');
define('DB_DRIVER',   'mysql');
define('DB_PERSISTENT', true);

//and your basepath
define('BASEPATH', 'http://your-ip/Curriculum-Submission-Network/');

So yeah, a lot of things are in experimental mode, sorry its kinda broken
but ill fix em in the next commit

any doubts, questions, complains please comment here or send me an email => edurart@gmail.com
