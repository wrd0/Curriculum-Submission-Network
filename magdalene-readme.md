 Lightweight PHP MVC Framework



Magdalene its exactly that, a minimul lightweight MVC Framework 
its provides a clean eviroment for web application development and
its so easy to understand that anyone can modify it to suit their own needs.

    I know currently is not really a framework framework ... but it helps a lot!
	I'll keep adding feautures to it until it gets robust and awesome
	
Now, set up application/config/config.php 
you know just PDO variables..

define('DB_HOSTNAME', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'assignment1');
define('DB_DRIVER',   'mysql');
define('DB_PERSISTENT', true);

define('BASEPATH', 'http://your-ip/Curriculum-Submission-Network/');
